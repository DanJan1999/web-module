            Daniel is a current student with Devmountain going through their bootcamp course. He has had an interest in computers and always liked to "see behind the curtain". He wanted to learn this skill. Before he started that journey, he was a music major at BYU playing percussion. He enjoys playing many instruments like drums, guitar, ukulele, bass, and piano! Daniel lives in South Jordan, Utah and is excited to be so close to the Silicon Slopes of Lehi where his opportunity for career growth is broad and exciting!
