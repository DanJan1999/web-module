How does the internet work?

The internet is a vast connection of networks. These networks are series of connected computers. 
A computer can reach content by following trails that allow it to ask for that content. 
It starts with itself, locally. Then it branches out to other computers sharing that same network.
If it doesn't find it, it reaches out to the next level up of networks connected together, so on.
Once it reaches the content, it brings it back to itself and follows through on that request.
This process is repeated for every request whether you are dealing with content stored locally or remotely.


What happens when you click a link?

When you click a link, you are clicking on a series of recognizable words so we can identify the 
request we are making. However, when the computer reads that link it reads the DNS of that link. 
The DNS is a series of numbers that specifically identify a location on the internet. When the link is clicked,
the computer follows the process described in the paragraph above, to find the address and request access to it. 
A number of different responses can be sent back which tell the computer whether the site can be reached or 
whether or not the site is working and many many others. The interaction of the computer and a link, as well as anything
done on the webpage makes up a series of requests and responses between the computer(client) and the webpage(server).
This request/response relationship between the client and the server make up the interaction that billions of people use every 
day. That's surfing the web!
